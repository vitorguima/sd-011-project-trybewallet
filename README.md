#Trybe Wallet Project

This project was done so I could practice the concepts that I have studied about React and Redux. The Ideia of Trybe Wallet was to create a simple financial manager where a user could:

 * Add, remove and edit an expense;
 * Visualize the registered expenses in a table format;
 * Visualize an expense in different type of currencies;

## Practicing skills:

  * Redux Store

  * Reducers

  * Redux actions

  * Redux Dispatchers

  * Async Redux actions
